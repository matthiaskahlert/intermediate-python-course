# Intermediate Python Course

Hey there, 

With this course I have created a dice-rolling program using python in the git bash.
The code is created and stored in the dice-roller.py file. 
This repo also contains course materials under the issues tab. 

The Game has the following fdeatures:

# playername input for 2 players
  You can set two Playernames to compete against each other
  
# user input about the dice
	How many sides has the dice?
	How many dice you want to roll?
  
# special player rolls (critical hits and fails with lowest and highest numbers)
Critical hits will count +15 Points
Critical misses will count -5 Points

# comparing the values of the rolls
YouÂ´ll see how you and your opponent has rolled

# aftermath	to derive a winner
Game Over - Who is the Winner?
